# vocal-point
VocalPoint is a low-cost classroom speaking kiosk for primary ESL. Pupils take turns at a tablet, read short lines, and get instant traffic-light feedback (green/yellow/red) from offline ASR. Teachers see a live dashboard, save attempts with names/classes, and export CSV reports. Works without internet; simple, fast, and motivating. Great for labs.
